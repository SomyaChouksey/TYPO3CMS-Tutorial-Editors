Access Control
==============

Access control is about visibility of content on your website.

There are many ways to restrict access to pages, content elements
and other information in your TYPO3 CMS installation. Options can range from
hiding pages in menus, to limiting visibility of content for a set time
period, all the way through to requiring visitors to log in to view content.

These various options are presented in this chapter.
