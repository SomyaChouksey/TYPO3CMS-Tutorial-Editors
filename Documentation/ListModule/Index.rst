Records
=======

The list module allows you to browse through
each page or folder within your site and view all of the records that
are stored within it. The List Module also gives you the ability to 
create and manage records that don't have a dedicated Module.

Sub pages, content elements and news stories are examples of the different
kinds of records that can be stored on any given page.

For example, a typical page would consist of several content elements that
contain text and images. By using the list module, you can see every content element
stored on that page, even if its set to hidden.
